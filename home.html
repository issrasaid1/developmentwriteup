    <h1>Development: Car shopping React application</h1>

  <h4 style="font-family:'Helvetica'; font-style: italic; text-align:center"> The goal of this project was to create a list interface using React. I created an application that allows people to shop for cars.
    They are able to filter the car that they are interested in by size (small vs SUV) and by type (luxury vs affordable). The user is also able to sort the cars by price from low to high.
    Finally, they can choose the car(s) they are interested in and add to cart. <br> Here is the link to the application: <a href="https://obscure-caverns-31758.herokuapp.com">Car Shopping.</a> I have also linked my github repo with my code for the app here: <a href="https://github.com/issrasaid1/development1">Repo.</a></h4> <br>

  <h2 style="font-family:'Helvetica';text-align:center"> Usability principles </h2>

  <p style="font-family:'Helvetica';text-align:center"> In order to allow optimal usability for the user, I considered a few usability principles when creating this application. For one, I kept visual-hierarchy in mind when designing.
    For example, I use larger font sizes to indicate headings on the page. I also made the titles for each item in bold so that the user can distinguish between the name of the car model and the rest of its details (e.g. type, size, price, etc).
    Furthermore, I made my filtering and sorting options acessible through drop down menus, rather than individual buttons.
    I did this so the user is able to easily see the current state of filtering and sorting. It also allows for a cleaner design as opposed to traditional buttons.
    </p>
    <h2 style="font-family:'Helvetica';text-align:center"> Conclusion </h2>

  <p style="font-family:'Helvetica';text-align:center">  This project allowed me to practice working with frameworks in React.js such as bootstrap. I also learned more about
    how an effective use of components and states allows for the creation of a clearer architecture. Overall, creating this list interface gave me a good first exposure to desigining web apps using React. </p>
